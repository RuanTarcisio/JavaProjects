Variations:
-This game exclusively has a single player mode which is the best known and the most fun mode to play with.

-The original game does have the automatic changes changes in interval after a few turns as mentioned above. On the other hand, I set the times in ms based on an educated guess and personal preference. I could not find the real time intervals from the physical game.

Variation and Extra:
-I implemented and modified the REPEAT button, pressing this button adds more time to the player to make a move and plays the sequence back. If the player has more than 3 points then the player will lose 3 points for using the button. This way the player will think twice about repeating the last sequence. The button. The button will hide when the game is won or lost by design. Spamming or abusing the button will make the player lose the game.

Extra:
-There are 3 high scores. The high scores are independent from each other and solely based on the Allotted Time difficulty and NOT on the Interval. In other words, if the conditions for a new high score occur, selecting Allotted Time "Easy" will make the new high score be saved for the "Easy" difficulty and so on for  medium and hard difficulties.

Extra:
-Interval and Allotted Time settings as previously explained. (And the combination of both)
